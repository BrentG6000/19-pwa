# 19-PWA

## Description

The motivation for creating this web app was to create a progressive web app that simulates a terminal text editor. Using this app you can practice typing into a bash terminal without having to install bash to your device. While creating this app I learned how to successfully deploy an app progressively so that it runs without the need for an internet connection.

## Installation

To install this app, you can either download the code from this repository or you can visit the live web site at https://protected-river-27350.herokuapp.com/. If you choose to download the code,
go to the root downloaded folder and run "npm i" in your terminal to install all node modules. Run "npm run start" to begin the program which will open your default browser with the app running.

## Usage

To use this app you can simply start typing in the text area. To install this app to your device click the install button. Your browser may ask you if you want to install the app. Answer yes and the app will
install to your system. The app will be available on your desktop even when there is no internet connection.
